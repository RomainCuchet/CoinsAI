    "Baht coins are very hard to identify has the 1 and 5 baht coins are composed of same mater (also the 2 for the newer version) and all have the king's face on one side. For a human it is easy to differenciate them based on their size. That is not the case for a computeer as he can't understand the scale of a coin without a scale. Moreover every network are taking a matrix of given side as an input. As a result we must reshape our images to match the desired shape. Some photographs are rectangular, others are squared and the dimensions are very different. Once resized, a coin on a rectangular picture will be resized and proportions wont be preserved wich increases complexity.\n",

    "R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) is a deep learning architecture that rcombines region proposals with convolutional neural networks. The region proposal layer returns bounding boxes that are likely to contain objects. Then a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) operates features extraction and return an output feature vector for every region. After that an SVM (Support Vector Machine) determine wether or not a region belong to one specific categorie using a one-vs-all SVM classifiers. To finish a bounding box regressor is applied to better fit the object. To sum up the R-CNN pipeline is the folowwing : \n",
